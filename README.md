# Student Progress Snapshot
_A hybrid text and visual Learning Analytics Dashboard_

In recent years, virtual learning environments, laptops, tablets and mobile devices have been introduced in the classroom. These technologies start a snowball effect: the old tools teachers used to fathom the students’ learning progress, since so much happens online, are not enough. Thus, the need for new tools to analyse the students’ activity on the online learning environments arises. The field of learning analytics can provide some of these tools.

We introduce the Student’s Progress Snapshot (SPS), a Learning Analytics Dashboard that allows teachers to analyse the activity of their students on Moodle courses. The SPS running as software as a service, includes both charts and automatically generated explanatory texts of these charts.
